It seems that I might not be very skilled at explaining things clearly, which is probably why you've landed here. I'm here to assist you. Since explaining isn't my thing, I'll do my best to guide you through the process.

## Getting Started with Python
1. First, you'll need Python. Download the latest version. [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Once the download is complete, run the setup.
3. During installation, ensure that the 'Add python.exe to PATH' box is checked.

4. Wait for the setup to finish.

## Checking If Python Is Installed
1. After installation, open the command prompt by searching for 'cmd'.
2. In the command prompt, type `python`.
3. You should see something like 'Python X.X.X' displayed.

## Installing Required Libraries
1. To proceed, you'll need the required libraries.
2. If you've closed the command prompt, reopen it.
3. Enter the following command: `pip install Pillow colorama`.
4. Wait for the download to finish.

## Running the Program
1. Download the project from the repository.

2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.
3. Run the 'terminal.py' file.
4. The program will prompt you to select a font:
   - Choose A Font From 1 To 4.
5. Next, the program will ask you to choose a color:
   - Type 1 for blue.
   - Type 2 for orange.
6. If you select the color orange, the program will then prompt you to choose the specific type of orange you'd like:
   - Type 1 for Orange 1.
   - Type 2 for Orange 2.
7. Once the font and color are selected, the program will ask you to input the text you want to convert to the style of Metal Slug.
8. Enter your desired text and press 'enter'.
## Viewing the Result
1. After pressing 'enter', the generated image should appear in the same directory.
2. You'll find it within a folder named 'Output'.

And that's pretty much it, I think! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.
