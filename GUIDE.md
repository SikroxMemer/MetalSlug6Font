It seems that I might not be very skilled at explaining things clearly, which is probably why you've landed here. I'm here to assist you. Since explaining isn't my thing, I'll do my best to guide you through the process.

## Getting Started with Python
1. First, you'll need Python. Download the latest version. [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Once the download is complete, run the setup.
3. During installation, ensure that the 'Add python.exe to PATH' box is checked.

4. Wait for the setup to finish.

## Checking If Python Is Installed
1. After installation, open the command prompt by searching for 'cmd'.
2. In the command prompt, type `python`.
3. You should see something like 'Python X.X.X' displayed.

## Installing Required Libraries
1. To proceed, you'll need the required libraries.
2. If you've closed the command prompt, reopen it.
3. Enter the following command: `pip install Pillow colorama`.
4. Wait for the download to finish.

## Running the Program
1. Get the latest release of the program. [Here](https://github.com/VermeilChan/MetalSlugFont/releases)
2. Run the program.
3. The program will ask you to choose a font from a selection of 4.
4. Note that some fonts might not support certain symbols.
5. Refer to the 'SUPPORTED.md' file to check symbol compatibility.
6. The program will prompt you to input the text you want to convert to the style of Metal Slug.
7. Enter your desired text and hit 'enter'.

## Viewing the Result
1. After pressing 'enter', the generated image should appear in the same directory.
2. You'll find it within a folder named 'Output'.

And that's pretty much it, I think! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.
