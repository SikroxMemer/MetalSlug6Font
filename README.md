# Metal Slug Font

Create captivating images using the iconic Metal Slug font style! Compose text with the distinct typography from the beloved Metal Slug arcade game series. This tool empowers you to fashion images of your text with customizable spacing, accommodating characters, numbers, and symbols.

**Important Note:** This software version is still in its developmental phase and operates through a terminal-based interface. Please be advised that it might necessitate certain adjustments to ensure optimal functionality across diverse operating systems, including Linux and MacOS. Given its early developmental stage, a few bugs currently inhabit the system. We strongly recommend exercising caution and refraining from experimenting with this version until further refinements are introduced. Alternatively, you can continue utilizing the web application until the official website becomes accessible. If the website isn't available, you have the option to host the application on your local machine. Comprehensive instructions can be found in the README.md file on the master branch for supplementary information.

## Linux

**Note for Linux Users:**
Python is often preinstalled on most Linux operating systems.

If you are using a Linux distribution that does not come with Python pre-installed, you can install it using the following commands:

For Ubuntu and Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install python3
```
For Fedora and CentOS:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3
```
For Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S python3
```
Once Python is installed, you can verify the installation by running the following command:
```bash
python3 --version
```
This will print the version of Python that is installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VermeilChan/MetalSlugFont.git
   ```
   ```
   cd MetalSlugFont
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Metal Slug Font:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to create Metal Slug font images.

## Usage

1. Input the desired text to transform it into the Metal Slug font style.
2. The generated image will be saved on your desktop.

## Converting to Executable

If you wish to convert the terminal-based script into a Windows executable (.exe), you can consider using Wine. Wine allows you to run Windows applications on Linux and MacOS.

Here are guides for installing and setting up Wine on various Linux distributions:

| Debian             | [WineHQ Debian Guide](https://wiki.winehq.org/Debian) |
| Fedora             | [WineHQ Fedora Guide](https://wiki.winehq.org/Fedora) |

**MacOS Guide:**
