# Metal Slug Font Generator

Create captivating images with the iconic Metal Slug font style! Easily transform your text into visually appealing images reminiscent of the Metal Slug arcade game series. This tool allows you to craft images with custom character spacing and supports a wide range of characters, numbers, and symbols.

**Note:** The terminal-based version of the program is now stable and recommended for use. The web app is no longer actively maintained, but you can still access it if preferred. This terminal version also offers a wider selection of fonts than the web app.
