**Note for Linux Users:**
Python is often preinstalled on most Linux operating systems.

If you are using a Linux distribution that does not come with Python pre-installed, you can install it using the following commands:

For Ubuntu and Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install python3
```
For Fedora and CentOS:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3
```
For Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S python3
```
Once Python is installed, you can verify the installation by running the following command:
```bash
python3 --version
```
or
```bash
python --version
```
This will print the version of Python that is installed on your system.
